# C programming - Pointers

Course taught by Huw Collingbourne, it's expected that the student is already familiar with the basic C language syntax. We will learn:

- What pointers are and how we can use them
- Understand the concept of memory addresses and indirection (dereference)
- How to do memory allocation and also how to free memory
- Pointers arithmetic
- Using pointers to arrays and array elements

At end of this course you will be able to understand why a struct can sometimes take up more memory than the data it contains, and why not cause problems when allocating memory, how to create linked lists with single ou double links, and how to add and delete list elements from the end of a list or from somewhere in the middle.

In this course we will also cover the use of pointers with special types such as stocks and queues, how to use pointers to functions or even ho to use an array of function pointers, and finally we will experience some common problems that you experience with pointers: memory leaks, dereferencing null pointers, pointers out of scope, errors to do with type casting, and problems whem making deep and shallow copies.

At some point you may think that some topics are quite hard to grasp, however, don't give up and reproduces the code provided and play with it until you have sure that understand the lesson before moving on.

Many books and tutorials on C programming tend to be quite vague on what a pointer variable really is. They show pointers as arrows pointing to memory locations but without explaining what those arrows are, or how a pointer knows where to point. And is vital for you to realize that these arrows were just diagrams, they don't really show what a pointer is or how it works. Diagrams with arrows are sometimes useful but, they don't truly represent what pointers really are. Pointers are just a bit of data, a value number, you must need to understand that at the outset, only once you've understood what a pointer is these kind of diagrams will start to make some sort of sense.
