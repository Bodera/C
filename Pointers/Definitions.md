# Fundamental Concepts

__Pointer__ ➜ a pointer is a special kind of variable that holds a memory address at run time. This address is the location of some object in memory and it's always a number. The declaration of a pointer is like the following:

```c
type *pointer;
```

---

__Memory__ ➜ it's a computer resource that refers to the non-volatile memory used by programs in they execution time. It stores temporal data that is lost when the program is closed. Frankly, memory is just an array of bytes, and memory addresses act just like the indexes of a normal array, so a memory address is a unique identifier used for data tracking.

---

__Indirection__ ➜ a.k.a. *dereferencing*, means accessing some sort of data stored at the address given by a pointer.

---

__Arrays__ ➜ 

---

uma sequência de itens de dados armazenados no mesmo local na memória, seu endereço é idêntico ao do primeiro item que comporta pois nele que o array começa. O nome da variável também é seu endereço.

__String__ ➜ a string is simply an array of characters.
